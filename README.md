# MILP-Tool-for-Cryptanalysis-of-Bit-Oriented-Block-Ciphers
This tool uses mixed-integer-linear-programming (MILP) to find the minimum number of differentially and linearly active S-boxes in bit-oriented block ciphers. It can also identify impossible differential and zero-correlation linear trails. For more details, visit: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VkDEjezc8PJR6m0JA8kaizTNV4IjLT1W
